# datetime module

Python has the datetime module to help deal with timestamps in your code. Time values are represented with the time class. Times have attributes for hour, minute, second, and microsecond. They can also include time zone information. The arguments to initialize a time instance are optional, but the default of 0 is unlikely to be what you want.

## time
Let's take a look at how we can extract time information from the datetime module. We can create a timestamp by specifying datetime.time(hour,minute,second,microsecond)


```python
import datetime

t = datetime.time(4, 20, 1)

# Let's show the different components
print(t)
print('hour  :', t.hour)
print('minute:', t.minute)
print('second:', t.second)
print('microsecond:', t.microsecond)
print('tzinfo:', t.tzinfo)
```

    04:20:01
    hour  : 4
    minute: 20
    second: 1
    microsecond: 0
    tzinfo: None
    

Note: A time instance only holds values of time, and not a date associated with the time. 

We can also check the min and max values a time of day can have in the module:


```python
print('Earliest  :', datetime.time.min)
print('Latest    :', datetime.time.max)
print('Resolution:', datetime.time.resolution)
```

    Earliest  : 00:00:00
    Latest    : 23:59:59.999999
    Resolution: 0:00:00.000001
    

The min and max class attributes reflect the valid range of times in a single day.

## Dates
datetime (as you might suspect) also allows us to work with date timestamps. Calendar date values are represented with the date class. Instances have attributes for year, month, and day. It is easy to create a date representing todayâ€™s date using the today() class method.

Let's see some examples:


```python
today = datetime.date.today()
print(today)
print('ctime:', today.ctime())
print('tuple:', today.timetuple())
print('ordinal:', today.toordinal())
print('Year :', today.year)
print('Month:', today.month)
print('Day  :', today.day)
```

    2020-06-10
    ctime: Wed Jun 10 00:00:00 2020
    tuple: time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=10, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=162, tm_isdst=-1)
    ordinal: 737586
    Year : 2020
    Month: 6
    Day  : 10
    

As with time, the range of date values supported can be determined using the min and max attributes.


```python
print('Earliest  :', datetime.date.min)
print('Latest    :', datetime.date.max)
print('Resolution:', datetime.date.resolution)
```

    Earliest  : 0001-01-01
    Latest    : 9999-12-31
    Resolution: 1 day, 0:00:00
    

Another way to create new date instances uses the replace() method of an existing date. For example, you can change the year, leaving the day and month alone.


```python
d1 = datetime.date(2015, 3, 11)
print('d1:', d1)

d2 = d1.replace(year=1990)
print('d2:', d2)
```

    d1: 2015-03-11
    d2: 1990-03-11
    

# Arithmetic
We can perform arithmetic on date objects to check for time differences. For example:


```python
d1
```




    datetime.date(2015, 3, 11)




```python
d2
```




    datetime.date(1990, 3, 11)




```python
d1-d2
```




    datetime.timedelta(9131)



This gives us the difference in days between the two dates. You can use the timedelta method to specify various units of times (days, minutes, hours, etc.)

Great! You should now have a basic understanding of how to use datetime with Python to work with timestamps in your code!
